Since I was given my first computer in 2000, I’ve been learning about them, how they work and how to make them. I love working with my hands so I went into light manufacturing to pay my way while I learned to code.

There came a point when I realised a career in tech was achievable, so I decided to change tack and applied for the WDI course at GA. The course is immersive and high pressure, providing the perfect environment for me to thrive and grow quickly.
In recent months, I have discovered an affinity for logic and web back-end, so I’ve decided to pursue systems architecture as my long-term goal. In order to get there I mean to find a job that will let me stretch my legs in the field, making elegant, concise and secure back-ends, from where I can expand my knowledge and move on to greater things.

## Hobbies

Above all else I'm into computer hardware, I've been buying end-of-life datacenter hardware because price to performance is mental. I'm running a website off a dual-Xeon machine in my bedroom, I have to frequently change the DNS settings because I have a dynamic IP.
I buy this stuff because I want to experiment with new technologies like neural networks, alongside virtualization, advanced home-networking etc.

# Others
- Cycling
- Sailing
- Good coffee
- Folk music and Americana
- Hiking and wild camping
