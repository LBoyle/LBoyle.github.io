I really enjoy making cool stuff.

## Hobbies

I spend most of my money on old server hardware, playing with anything interesting, trying Linux distros, playing with virtual machines, web and game servers and Python, basic machine learning. I really enjoy using powerful computers like my super cheap frankenstein’s monster machine, though the energy bill is burning a hole in my pocket. I do ‘restarter parties’ every now and then, fixing electronics for free for people who don’t know how.
I would call web development a hobby, it certainly was before I began studying in earnest. 

I do some sailing and sailing instruction, cycling, hiking and wild camping, downhill skateboarding, I used to row and fence. One of my long term goals is to buy a yacht and sail it around the world.
I kick serious butt at a Dragon Ball Z game for PS2, and I do some speedrunning and looking for exploits, I’ve spent less time invested in games recently.
I like cooking and eating healthy, mostly, or eating cake, good coffee and good gin.
I play a lot of guitar, and go to a few music events, I recently saw Hiatus Kaiyote, Thundercat, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Leftfield, not at the same time sadly, and I want to see Snarky Puppy.
