# golang

I can't resist, I have to give it a go. (No wordplay intended)

## Microservice

A simple microservice style API with MongoDB, only restful route missing is update. Used goji with mux for routing, made it easier.

## Mongo

Interfacing an app with MongoDB using MGO.

## MUX Routing

Made a server that sends JSON responses to HTTP requests. Used MGO for routing, made a couple of structs.
