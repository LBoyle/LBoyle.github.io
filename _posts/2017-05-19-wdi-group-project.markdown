This was the third project on the WDI course at General Assembly, I was part of a four-person team. The brief was to produce an AngularJS website on top of a Node / Express RESTful API.

WHAT'S YOUR BEEF is an app directed at both vegans and non-vegans who can share their own vegan recipe versions of various cuisines.

The user can register and login and then can navigate the website easily by clicking on the cuisine they are interested in. Then a list of all the recipes under that cuisine appear and the user is able to choose one. The recipe show page has various information on ingredients used, instructions and the chef's profile page where they can navigate and check out more recipes by that particular chef.

Check it out on [Heroku][heroku-url]

Or my fork on [Github][github-url]


We used the following techs
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- AngularJS
- Node.js
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Angular JWT
