This was a homework I did in a group of three over the space of about four hours. My contributions were the whole back-end api, and all authentication, front and back.

The user can register and login and then can view, create, update and delete dinosaurs from the database, also users can post comments on individual dinosaurs.

Check out the [front-end][github-frontend-url]

Or the [back-end][github-backend-url]


We used the following techs
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby on Rails
- AngularJS
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Angular JWT
