summary: Twitter visualization map displaying the results of sentiment analysis on tweets concerning Brexit.
---


This was my first proper group project, it collected tweets that matched topics like "Brexit" or "Remain" from within the UK if a location was provided, performed sentiment analysis on the body then saved the location and sentiment score to our database.

We then sent the results in a JSON to the front-end to display them over a map. We also displayed the numbers for and against.

On the last night before the result, it had, by chance, predicted 52% to 48% for, much to our dismay, though we disregarded it because of the results turned out to be nonsense.

It proved very difficult to accurately gauge sentiment for or against anything, the tweets were far from computer-readable. What we displayed in the end was whether people talking about it were writing in a positive or negative manner.
