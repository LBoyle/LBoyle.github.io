summary: pcBuilderApp (working title) is an app which makes it simpler to design and build a computer, removing the guesswork for which parts will play ball with together.

pcBuilderApp is a tool aimed at PC gamers, enthusiasts and beginner home-builders that checks PC component compatibility. It is meant to be easier to use than competitors, which are often layers of forms that are hard to navigate. With each part you choose, the form filters out any incompatible parts with virtually seamless updates.

I chose this product because I have had trouble with these services in the past and from a novices point of view, hard to navigate. I have a good knowledge of consumer hardware, I figured I should do something that's interesting to me. 

I handed in the second iteration, I think I exceeded my initial plans with the form functionality. With some work on the UI and seeded data it could be really cool.

It was an exploration of the relational database and some of the packages available for AngularJS.
